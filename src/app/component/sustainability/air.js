              Well, we all know the answer to that question is a simple yes. While all is not <br />
              lost yet, we have to start taking small but responsible steps toward improving <br />
              the current situation and future preservation.

              Climate change is inescapable and Welspun understands the importance of <br />
              swiftly and pro-actively lowering the energy and carbon footprint, How will we <br />
              achieve this? We are working on phasing out our dependence on fossil fuels <br />
              for energy generation and adopting renewable energy sources. We track every <br />
              ounce of fossil fuel used and electricity consumed in our operations and <br />
              report them under the Scope I & 2 emissions. We are also replacing virgin raw <br />
              materials with more recycled materials.
