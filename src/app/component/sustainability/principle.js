            The Indian value systems, ingrained in our cultural roots are implemented in all our operations and supply chains to prevent any <br />
            forms of environmental damage from our operations. Our focus on the 4R's is of the order: first to reduce, then to reuse followed <br />
            by repurposing and recycling. The adoption of the above principle is not limited to material management alone but is extended <br />
            to the utilisation of other resources such as water, electricity, etc. We are a Zero Liquid discharge facility.
